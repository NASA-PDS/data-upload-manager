# Coverage Testing
# ----------------
#
# The ``coverage`` tool helps ensure that all parts of your code is actually

# this.

# See https://coverage.readthedocs.io/ for more.

# Flake8
# ------
#
# Flake8 (pronounced "flay-kate") is a Python style guide tool. It checks your
# code against a library of "best practices" for writing Python and lets you
# know when things aren't quite the "best". There are numerous options below
# and you can read more about the tool at https://flake8.pycqa.org/

# Ignoring:
# E203 prevents flake8 from complaining about whitespace around slice
# components. Black formats per PEP8 and flake8 doesn't like some of
# this.
#
# E501 prevents flake8 from complaining line lengths > 79. We will use
# flake8-bugbear's B950 to handle line length lint errors. This trips
# when a line is > max-line-length + 10%.
#
# W503 is ignored for not just because it makes use of
# left-aligned binary operators in multi-line expressions, but because the
# opposite advice is now the recommended practice; see

#   B902: Invalid first argument used for method. Use self for instance
#       methods, and cls for class methods
#   B903: Use collections.namedtuple (or typing.NamedTuple) for data classes
#       that only set attributes in an __init__ method, and do nothing else.
#   B950: Line too long. This is a pragmatic equivalent of pycodestyle's
#       E501: it considers "max-line-length" but only triggers when the value
#       has been exceeded by more than 10%.
